*This page contains my TODO items, which is inspired by the same type of page by [Yihui Xie (someone I look up to!)](https://yihui.org/todo/).This page is intended to align with my value of transparency. This page is currently a work in progress! I am using the same overall guidance for how you should use this To Do List below:*

This page contains my TODO items, which I try to update every day. I guess I will never be able to finish all the work, so I will appreciate your help with any of the items on this page (fixing bugs, answering questions, or implementing features). Please feel free to let me know if you want to work on anything, and I will be happy to assist you.

Looking at these items, you may make a better decision on whether to ask questions on a public forum before emailing me, according to my current status below. Please feel free to email me anyway if you do not need a prompt response, and please forgive my slow response.
